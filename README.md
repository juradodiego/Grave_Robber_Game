A 2D Platformer Game, made with Godot.

This is a project I'm starting over my final Winter break at the University of Pittsburgh 
to recap all of the skills and knowledge I've learned from my courses as a Computer Science 
major and my interest in Game Design and the courses I've taken to support this interest.

Main Goals of v1.0.0:
1. Have at least 3 playable levels
2. Player chacter movement and comabt
3. 2 different enemy types: skeleton, and skeleton wizards
4. Equipable gear
5. Playable on desktop
